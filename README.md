# Pro README Generator

## Description

In this UofT Coding Bootcamp challenge I have created a README.md generator.  Writing it challenged my understanding of not only the flexibility of JavaScript but also how to work around a lack of browser via Node JS.  I learned a lot more about understanding JS because I had to rely only on reading the script, not visualizing what was happening by loading an HTML into a browser.

## Usage

Run the application from Command line using node index.js.  You will be prompted with a series of questions asking you about the application that your are creating a README for.  Once you have entered each answer, the generator will create a newREADME.md which will have all of your answers inside in the corresponding sections. You can use the table of contents to view any section you click.  When you click the license badge at the top you will be brough to a page with more information about the license you chose.  The github link will bring you to the github profile of the username you entered.  The email link should open up an new email in your default email browser addressed to the address you entered.
